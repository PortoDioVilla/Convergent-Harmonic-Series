# Convergent-Harmonic-Series
Simple python programs designed to generate tables and values for various types of harmonic series

Summary: It is well known that a) the harmonic series does not converge, whereas the alternating harmonic series does converge. In fact, this series is basically the motivation for alternating series in general. Proving the convergence and divergence of these series is reasonably easy, but how can one determine the convergence of a series with every 3rd term oppositely signed? The aim of the programs in this repository is to gain insight through empirical results and so called 'permutations" of series like this.
