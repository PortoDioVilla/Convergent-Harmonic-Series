# Convergent-Harmonic-Series
Simple python programs designed to generate tables and values for various types of harmonic series

Summary: It is well known that a) the harmonic series does not converge, whereas the alternating harmonic series does converge. In fact, that series is basically the motivation for even studying alternating series, in general. Proving the convergence and divergence of these series is reasonably easy, but how can one determine the convergence of a series with every 3rd term oppositely signed? Put another way, is there a way to determine whether a series will converge based only on the ratio of its positive terms to its negative terms? The aim of the programs in this repository is to gain insight through empirical results and so called 'permutations" of series like this.

This could be the basis for a thesis if it pans out :)

update post 337, during 236: another interesting comparison seems to be ratios of signs, not just modular exponents. But also, 
TAYLOR SERIES: VER. RELEVANT
MERCAOTR SERIES: taylor series of natural log (ln)
